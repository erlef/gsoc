The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation has applied to the  [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) 2021. The ErlEf is a great place to spend a summer learning, coding, participating and contributing in Erlang, Elixir, LFE, and other technologies based on the BEAM. We are an exciting open source foundation with a vibrant community of projects, and we look forward to your application and your project ideas!

In this page, we will list projects (alphabetically) that are participating in the GSoC. Click on the project below to see all proposals/ideas related to that project:
