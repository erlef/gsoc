Erlang and Elixir are known as powerful languages for building large-scale distributed applications.
riak_core_lite a framework that simplifies the development of dynamo-style architectures, such as highly-available key-value stores or messaging systems.
It is an extraction of the essence of the RiakKV's core and provides an up-to-date, modular and extensible foundation for elastic distributed services.

### # Idea 1: Implementation of a Dynamo-style KV-Store

Design and implement a reference implementation of a key-value store on top of riak_core_lite.
You can follow Mariano's [riak_core_tutorials](https://marianoguerra.github.io/riak-core-tutorial/) as a starting point.

* Knowledge prerequisites: Basic knowledge in Erlang or Elixir.


### # Idea 2: Testing

Design and implement a test harness for riak_core_lite.

There are different approaches possible:
- Property-based tests
- Integration tests with Erlang's Common Tests
- Distributed System testing using fault-injection tools
- Formal modeling and verification with TLA+

* Knowledge prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Erlang/Elixir and testing.
